Big shoutouts to [Aendawyn](https://ldj.am/$315825) without whomst I couldn't have published my game in time. Also [Play their game aswell!](https://ldj.am/$315866)

Harvest the fruits from the tree. One at a time! Then bring them to the crate, simple as that.

Known bugs:
- ~~Golden Apples won't get collect. The rest of their code works.~~ (fixed!)
- ~~You start with 40 points.~~ (fixed!)
- ~~Points are not saved between sessions.~~ (fixed!)
- "Leave Game" softlocks the game when played in the browser. Your score gets saved! Simple reload fixes it for now. The game will currently save your points only when you press "leave game"

**Will work on the game for the next 3 weeks, and maybe beyond, to add more features polish and gameplay!**
