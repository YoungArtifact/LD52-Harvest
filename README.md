Big shoutouts to [Aendawyn](https://ldj.am/$315825) without whomst I couldn't have published my game in time. Also [Play their game aswell!](https://ldj.am/$315866)

Harvest the fruits from the tree. One at a time! Then bring them to the crate, simple as that.

Known bugs:
- Golden Apples won't get collect. The rest of their code works.
- You start with 40 points.

**Will work on the game for the next 3 weeks, and maybe beyond, to add more features polish and gameplay!**
